## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add restart to ESP32
- Optimize nRF BLE power consumption, now the idle current is decreased to about 20uA

### Changed

- Decouple the matrix(input device) and keyboard implementation
- Stop scanning matrix after releasing all keys
- Use divider to estimate battery voltage
- Create Debouncer and Matrix in `run_rmk_*` function ahead of time instead of in the `initialize_*_and_run` function.

### Fixed

- Fix unexpected power consumption for nRF
- Fix extra memory usage by duplicating keymaps
- Fix COL/ROW typo
